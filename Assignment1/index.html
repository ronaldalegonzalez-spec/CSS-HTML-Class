Uh-uh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Uh-uh, yeah </p>

<h4>Chorus</h4>
<p>She don't wanna strip no more, don't wanna hit that pole (Oh)
Hit my old plug, I get it in and go (Ooh, ooh)
Shawty owe me something, better pay your toll (Pay up, pay up)

Scrape the bowl (Skrrt, skrrt), scrape the bowl (Skrrt, skrrt)</p>

<h4>Verse 1</h4>
<p>Like, did you get the memo?
She eat at out of the relay
I'm poppin' hella Skittles
Then I can solve your riddle
We'll smoke you like it's menthol
This dude is crazy mental
A suave, hood hеro
Got Johnny Dang dental
She's a nympho
She slobbin' on hеr pillow
Got chicken, Rob' De Niro
She's too gone and she can't hear you (Ooh, ooh, I know)</p>

<h4>Chorus</h4>
<p>She don't wanna strip no more, don't wanna hit that pole
Hit my old plug, I get it in and go
She don't wanna strip no more, don't wanna hit that pole (Oh)
Hit my old plug, I get it in and go (Ooh, ooh)
Shawty owe me something, better pay your toll (Pay up, pay up)
I lick the spoon and I scrape the bowl (Skrrt, skrrt)
Scrape the bowl (Skrrt, skrrt), scrape the bowl (Skrrt, skrrt)</p>

<h4>Verse 2</h4>
<p>Seein' way too many ones
I'm 'bout to throw some hundreds (I'm 'bout to throw some hundreds)
In that old life that you run from
Baby girl, keep running (Ooh, keep running)
It's pressure with me, sexually (Sexually)
Check my bank account (Ooh, ooh), it's precious to me
I got my anchor out (Ooh, ooh), I'm locked in your sea
You know you're my baby now, you're special to me
I bought you time, I bought you diamonds, you can keep the receipt
I got you down, I got you loose, I guess you owe it to me
Is you down or nah? Fuck around, find your spot
I get you lit, lit, drunk, trip
Watch me slip inside </p>

<h4>Chorus</h4>
<p>She don't wanna strip no more, don't wanna hit that pole (Oh)
Hit my old plug, I get it in and go (Ooh, ooh)
Shawty owe me something, better pay your toll (Pay up, pay up)
I lick the spoon and I scrape the bowl (Skrrt, skrrt)
Scrape the bowl (Skrrt, skrrt), scrape the bowl (Skrrt, skrrt)</p>


<h4>Outro</h4>
<p>And I sent her away
Pull out, sent her on her way
She don't wanna hit the strip club, no, no
She don't wanna go strip, no, no
She don't wanna go strip, no way</p>

    <h3>About the Song</h3>
    <p>"No Pole" is a song by American rapper and singer Don Toliver. It was released through Cactus Jack and Atlantic Records as the first track from the deluxe edition of his third studio album, Love Sick, on February 28, 2023. Toliver wrote the song with producers Cardo and DJ Fresh, alongside Dougie F. The song gained mainstream popularity over a year and a half after its release due to its use on the online video platform TikTok.</p>

    <p>The central theme of “No Pole” revolves around a lifestyle of indulgence, power dynamics, and personal relationships. Don Toliver narrates his experiences with a woman who is moving away from her previous life as a stripper, a shift symbolized in the chorus. He offers a glimpse into his own world, where money, control, and a sense of entitlement intertwine with his interactions. The song mixes playful confidence with a touch of vulnerability, exploring themes of loyalty, transactional relationships, and the tension between old habits and new desires.</p>
